# Fastcgi Container
Fastcgi Container is a framework for development of high performance FastCGI applications in C++.

Fastcgi Container is a branch of Yandex's [Fastcgi Daemon](<https://github.com/golubtsov/Fastcgi-Daemon).

What's new compared to Fastcgi Daemon:

* The package is written in C++11 and does not use Boost libraries anymore 
* Support of request filters
* Support of servlets as an extensions of request handlers
* Support of sessions
* Support of authentication and authorization 
* The framework provides Page Compiler - a command-line C++ server page compiler which generates C++ servlets from [JSP-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages) source files 

Note that all filters (including authentication/authorization filter) are executed under the FastCGI role "RESPONDER" and do not require that the roles "FILTER" and "AUTHORIZER" are supported by FastCGI connector (e.g. corresponding modules for Apache HTTPD).

# License 

[GPL v.3.0](LICENSE)

# Requirements

* A C++11 compliant compiler with complete support of C++11 regex (e.g., GCC 4.9 meets the minimum feature set required to build the package)
* GNU build system (Autotools)
* Currently the framework can be built on Linux only

# Dependencies

* [MNMLSTC Core](https://github.com/mnmlstc/core) - a C++11 library that adds several library features that are to be included in C++14 and beyond
* libfcgi
* libfcgi++
* libxml2
* libssl
* libcrypto

# Build

The project is using GNU Autotools. To build it, execute the following commands in the root directory of the project:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install 


# Docs

* [API](docs/API.md) (coming soon)
* [C++ Page Compiler](page-compiler/docs/page_compiler.md)

# Examples

The following examples are provided:

* Simple request handler
* Simple request filter
* Simple servlet
* Authentication filter
* Simple athorization realm

## Build

All examples except C++ server page are built together with the Fastcgi Container. 
To re-build them separately, execute the following commands:

	cd ./example/pages
	make

To build the example C++ server page, execute the following commands:

	cd ./example/pages
	fastcgi3-page-compiler -updateFactory=true -updateMakefile=true *.cpsp
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

## Configuring examples to run with HTTPD server 

Copy built example shared libraries from `example/.libs` and `example/page/.libs` as well as example configuration file `example/fastcgi.conf` into working directory (e.g. `~/tmp/fscgi`). Modify configuration file as appropriate.

Configure available HTTPD server to connect with Fastcgi Container. 

For example, to run examples via Unix socket with Apache2 HTTPD using modules `mod_poxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi`, add the following entries into Apache configuration file:

	ProxyPass /myapp/ unix:///var/lib/apache2/fcgid/fastcgi3-example.sock|fcgi://localhost/
 
To run examples via tcp socket, add the following entries into Apache configuration file:

	ProxyPass /myapp/ fcgi://localhost:8080/

If you want to run examples in clustered environment, enable the Apache module `mod_proxy_balancer` and add the following entries into Apache configuration:

	ProxyPass /myapp/ balancer://myappcluster/ stickysession=JSESSIONID|jsessionid
	<Proxy balancer://myappcluster/>
    	BalancerMember fcgi://localhost:8080
    	BalancerMember fcgi://localhost:8081
	</Proxy>

Note that you will need to configure two or more instances of Fastcgi Container either on different hosts or on the same host with different ports.

For more information, see Apache documentation:
 
* [mod_proxy](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html)
* [mod_proxy_fcgi](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html)
* [mod_proxy_balancer](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html)
 
## Running examples

Start HTTPD server as appropriate (e.g. `sudo /etc/init.d/apache start`).

Start Fastcgi Container with exmple configuration:

	cd ~/tmp/fscgi
	sudo fastcgi3-container --config=./fastcgi.conf
