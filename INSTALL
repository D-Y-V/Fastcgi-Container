Requirements
============

* A C++11 compliant compiler with complete support of C++11 regex (e.g., GCC 4.9 meets the minimum feature set required to build the package)
* CMake build system
* Currently the framework can be built on Linux only

Dependencies
============

* [MNMLSTC Core](https://github.com/mnmlstc/core) - a C++11 library that adds several library features that are to be included in C++14 and beyond
* libfcgi
* libfcgi++
* libxml2
* libssl
* libcrypto
* libuuid
* libdl

Build
=====

Make sure the MNMLSTC Core is available in your INCLUDE path. It should resolve properly the header files with prefix "core/" like:

	#include "core/any.hpp"

The project is using CMake as a build system. To build and install the package, execute the following commands in the root directory of the project:

	cmake .
	make
	sudo make install 

If your default compiler does not meet the minimum feature set required to build the package, you may specify alternative compiler as follows:  

	CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 cmake .
	make
	sudo make install 

In default configuration, the package will be installed with prefix `/usr`. If you want to change the prefix, you may specify it as follows:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local .
	make
	sudo make install 

or

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/bin/fastcgi-container .
	make
	make install 

For more information see documentation available on official [CMake site](http://www.cmake.org/documentation/).
